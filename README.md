# Soul Stroll

Zepler Studios team's very first game jam attempt, back in 2016

This game is total rubbish but you can [download a Windows build from Itch](https://teonistor.itch.io/soul-stroll) or [play it in the browser](https://teonistor.github.io/ggj16/Build_WebGL/). The whole thing takes about two minutes.
